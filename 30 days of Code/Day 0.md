## Day 0 : Hello, World

<br>

#### Objective
In this challenge, we review some basic concepts that will get you started with this series. You will need to use the same (or similar) syntax to read input and write output in challenges throughout HackerRank.

#### Task
To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World. on a single line, and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.


#### Output Format
Print `Hello, World.` on the first line, and the contents of `inputString` on the second line.


#### Given Code

```python
# Read a full line of input from stdin and save it to our dynamically typed variable, input_string.
input_string = input()

# Print a string literal saying "Hello, World." to stdout.
print('Hello, World.')

# TODO: Write a line of code here that prints the contents of input_string to stdout.
```

## Solution

```python
input_string = input()
print('Hello, World.')
print(input_string)
```

**Input**
```
